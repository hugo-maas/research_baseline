### Structural Consistency Notes
# **Methodology**: By using `bind_rows`, each top-level key in your YAML (like `project` or `parameters`) is treated as a single row where the sub-keys become columns.
# **Reliability**: This approach is more resilient than `data.frame()` when dealing with the list-based structures returned by `yaml.load_file`.
# **Visual Integrity**: The use of `is.na(df) <- "—"` ensures that your final rendered document maintains its solemnity by removing technical `NA` markers.
